# Project Name

SQL To-Do List

# Description

I built a to-do list application, using a full stack (see # Built with for a full list of frameworks and technologies).

# Installation

1. Create a database named 'weekend-to-do-app'.
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install

# Usage

1. Type in a task you would like to add to your to do list.
2. Click on Add Task to add to the list, both on the DOM and the database.
3. Once finished with the task, click Completed button. If you change your mind, you can click the button Incomplete to change it back to an unfinished task.
4. Click Delete to delete the task from the DOM and the database.
